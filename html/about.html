    <h3 class="about">
        <b>Who are we?</b> We are two high school students based in France who are trying to make the world a better place using our passion for tech. You can follow our adventures at our respective sites:
        <a href="https://colleserre.github.io" target="_blank">
            Daren Palmer
        </a> and

    <h3 class="about">
        <b>Why did we do this?</b> Daren was watching a documentary about social media and he was absolutely flabbergasted and was already coding for 2 years so he set out to build an app that would allow users to get a summary of their online privacy
        using Google's Flutter framework. He then remembered that the generous people over at <a href="https://tosdr.org" target="_blank">tosdr.org</a> had taken care of reading pages of privacy policies and compiling them into a handy API. Daren then
        requested the help of his good friend Adrien to help with the styling of the website and some other stuff that he couldn't be bothered to do. A few months passed and we now have a fully functionning website! We are pleased to launch our first
        offensive on the army of ruthless corporations that irule our digital world. We will not go down without a fight.

        <b>Are we going to stop producing quality code and apps to solve our planet's problems?</b> Hell no!
